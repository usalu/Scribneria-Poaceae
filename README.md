# Scribneria-Poaceae
Scribneria is part of the open-source project [Poaceae]. Here you will find all Grasshopper scripts components that are not integrated in any plugin yet. Every script is work in progress. The goal of Scribneria is to gather conglomerates of scripts to potentially create bundled plugins later.

## Organization
Scripts are organized in categories that describe the general purpose of the script. If you feel that a component is misplaced or you want to create a new category feel free to contact me([Ueli])!

## Contributing
If you have script components that you want to share with the world feel free to send a pull request and we will be happy to include it into the pool. Most people who use the script component will probably not know code. Therefore it is necessary that all the components are well described and all inputs and outputs have an understandable name and a precise description. [Here] you can find templates for C# and Python script components. Furthermore we have made a [checklist] with questions that we always ask ourselves before publishing a component. Besides that I wrote [6 guidelines] that I use to write script components. Maybe it helps you!
